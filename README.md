## API Documentation

We're using [REST Client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) to test API request.
**REST Client** is a VSCode extension to conveniently send and test REST request within the editor.

After install the extension, open `api.http` file and press "Send Request" on top of each pre-defeined requests. You need to set `@host` and `@api_token` in order to authenticate the request with Strapi.
